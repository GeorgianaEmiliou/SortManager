# SortManager Project

# Instructions
Firstly the user has to run the SortManager program in Intellij. Then some sorting methods will appear in the console. The user must type the number of the sorting method that they wish to use. If they enter an invalid input, the program ask again which sorting method the user wants, until to get a vallid input. After that, a message appears in the console which asks the size of the array. If the user gives a nagetive number, the message about the array size appears again, until the user gives a positive number. When the user enter a valid array size, a random array is created with the size that the user gave. The program then prints the random array before sorting and after sorting, using the sorting method which user gave. Also, the program prints the time that is taken to sort that specific array with that sorting method.
